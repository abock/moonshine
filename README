Moonlight Media Player leverages the Windows Media capabilities from 
Silverlight, provided by the Moonlight browser plugin, to provide a standalone
media player for local files, and enables the playback of legacy embedded
Windows Media content on the web.

It consists of two components:

  - Firefox/NPAPI plugin that handles legacy embedded Windows Media mime
    types. This plugin loads the Moonlight plugin and creates a XAML/JS 
    player to play the media. This enables web sites like hbo.com and
    c-span.com to work on Linux. Additionally, the Windows Media Player
    ActiveX/JavaScript API is implemented to enable the most compatibility.

  - Standalone XUL Runner application for playing back local WM content
    from a user's desktop. A .desktop file and launcher is provided for
    easy integration with Linux distributions.
